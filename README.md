# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on  <br>  Regression and classification ML projects in R and Python, plus optimisation problems in Python (including greedy algorithms and simple heuristics).<br><br>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on  <br>  Data analytics / data science projects with real experiment design, ML pipelines, and dashboards or reports that turn messy data into clear business stories.<br><br>🙋‍♀️ I’m looking for help with  <br>  Best practices for structuring production-style ML/AI projects, especially in supply chain, finance, and business intelligence settings.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning  <br>  Tree-based ML models in R (CART, bagging, random forests, boosting) and simulation / Monte Carlo style analysis in Python.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact  <br>  I once spent so long tweaking a hyperparameter grid for model tuning that I completely lost track of time…and only noticed when my laptop battery gave up 🧠📊<br>
